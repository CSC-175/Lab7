# Find The Reverse of a Multi-digit Number

## Background
<ul>
<li>When you multiply a decimal number by a power of 10, the value of each digit shifts left increasing by a power of 10.</li>
<li>Conversely, when dividing a decimal number by a power of 10, the value of each digit decreases, and the digits shift to the right. </li>
</ul>

## Directions
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a multiple digit positive integer then use a loop to iteratively construct the value that is the reverse 
of that number, add the two numbers together, and print the reverse value and sum to the screen. <b>Note: Be sure that your solution is not simply printing 
the digits of the number in reverse. For example, if the number 2468 was entered then your program will find the reverse number is 8462 and the sum of those 
two values is 11110.</b>

## Interface Prototype Example

### Test Case 1 Output
<pre><b>Enter the number to reverse: 426
The reverse of the number is 624
The sum of the two number is 1050</b></pre>
### Test Case 2 Output
<pre><b>Enter the number to reverse: 321
The reverse of the number is 123
The sum of the two number is 444</b></pre>
### Test Case 3 Output
<pre><b>Enter the number to reverse: 217496
The reverse of the number is 694712
The sum of the two number is 912208</b></pre>
